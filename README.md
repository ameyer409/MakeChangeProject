# MakeChangeProject

## How To Run
When Running the program, you will be prompted to enter the purchase price. This number must be greater than 0, but can be a decimal. Then you will be prompted to enter how much money you are using to pay for the purchase. This number must also be greater than 0, but can be a decimal. 

## Project Description
This project takes in the purchase price and cash tendered and outputs to the user how many of each bill and coin should be returned as change. The program always defaults to the highest denomination of currency possible, meaning if the change is $40, then even though four ten dollar bills would work, the program will suggest that the change be two twenty dollar bills.
